<p>The Shiny server has a few ways to host. There are two DNS entries mapped to the IP.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>shiny</em> routes to a root location for company-wide hosting applications.</li>
<li><em>shinyusers</em> routes to a user-specific folder for individual use.</li>
</ol>
<p>The configuration file is located at <code>/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf</code>, and a backup is attached.<a href="uploads/89be2397ad1386c0acfde145202aafdd/shiny-server.conf">shiny-server.conf</a></p>
<p>RStudio has extensive <a href="https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/">help information</a> on this topic.</p>
