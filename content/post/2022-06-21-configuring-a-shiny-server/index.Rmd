The Shiny server has a few ways to host. There are two DNS entries mapped to the IP.

1. *shiny* routes to a root location for company-wide hosting applications.
2. *shinyusers* routes to a user-specific folder for individual use.

The configuration file is located at `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`, and a backup is attached.[shiny-server.conf](uploads/89be2397ad1386c0acfde145202aafdd/shiny-server.conf)

RStudio has extensive [help information](https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/) on this topic.
